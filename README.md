## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of [AES-GCM](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf) in Circom. We have used circomkit to generate and test witnesses in the test files. We have also used to related rust code in the `src` generate test vectors from official cryptography libraries. The Circuits and circomkit tests are in the `circuits` directory.

#### Design Documents

### Prerequisites

To use this repo, you need to install the `just` command runner:

```sh
cargo install just
# or use cargo binstall for fast install:
cargo binstall -y just

# install dependencies
just install
```

### Testing
Test witnesses are validated by circomkits tests. These can be run with:
`just circom-test`

## Testing Circom
Example commands for using circom-kit
```
just circom-test # test all circom tests 
just circom-testg TESTNAME # test a named test

# also see:
`npx circomkit`: circomkit commands
`npx circomkit compile <circuit>`: equiv to `circom --wasm ...`
`npx circomkit witness <circuit> <witness.json>`: equiv to call generate_witness.js
```
